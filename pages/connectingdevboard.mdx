Embedd fully handles the integration of components with development boards. Please see the next section for a full list of supported boards. Enterprise users can also request support for custom boardsâ€”reach out to us here if interested.

Integration requires no BSP firmware for the board, as Embedd handles this automatically.

Watch this video Tutorial for the overview of the process:

Follow these steps for integration:

1. Select a development board from the list
2. Click "Get Firmware" to download the .hex file
3. Connect your board to the computer. If your board lacks an onboard debugger, connect through an external debugger
4. Use the appropriate tool for your board manufacturer to erase the board's memory and flash the firmware from step 2. Restart your board afterward
5. Verify that your device is connected to the development board using the interface and address configured in your Component Model. If you need to modify your configuration in Embedd, generate a new one and repeat these steps
6. In the testing tab, set your desired data exchange frequency (this determines how often values are read from the device) and click Connect
7. Upon successful connection, your development board and target interfaces will display green dots. Purple dots will appear above testing environment sections to indicate active data reception
