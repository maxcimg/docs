### DTS Generation

After the user has completed configuring all properties, creating nodes, and assigning pins in the device tree, the system provides the ability to generate the final DTS file. This step consolidates all of your configurations into a single, fully structured device tree source.

When generating the DTS file, the system performs several key tasks in the background:

1. **Pinmux Conversion** – All configured pin multiplexing (pinmux) settings are automatically calculated and converted into the exact format required by the DTS. This ensures that pin assignments match the hardware specifications without the user needing to manually adjust values.
2. **Pinctrl Node Assembly** – The system adds any required nodes to the pinctrl sections of the device tree, based on your pin assignments and peripheral configurations. This guarantees that all nodes are properly connected and follow the expected Zephyr bindings.
3. **Full DTS Assembly** – All the configured nodes, properties, and pin settings are compiled into a complete DTS file. The generated file is fully **syntactically correct**, adheres to binding rules, and is ready to be used in a Zephyr project without additional manual edits.

> **Important Note:** At this time, the system **does not support generating DTS overlays**. This functionality is currently under development and will be available in a future update.

> Please note that the generated DTS file can be downloaded regardless of the compilation result.
