An event refers to any significant occurrence or state change within the chip that triggers a predefined response or action. These events, generated by hardware or software, enable synchronization, control, and error handling.

Embedd currently supports 3 types of events:

- GPIO: triggered by interrupts (e.g., Timer Overflow, GPIO Pin Change, ADC Conversion Complete)
- Timer: triggered at specific time intervals
- Msg: triggered by messages

For each event, the model contains the following information:

| Section Name | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Name | Name of event |
| Type | Defines type of trigger: GPIO/Timer/Msg |
| Description  | Description of the event based on the datasheet  |
| Status register (GPIO only) | Defines register associated to the specific interrupt event  |
| Pin (GPIO only) | Defines pin associated to the specific interrupt event  |
| Interval (Timer only) | Defines period in ms |
| Length (Msg only) | Defines length of the message |
