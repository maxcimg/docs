### The Embedd UI has two main zones:

* Component Explorer

* Application Screen

**The Component Explorer is organised as follows:**

  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://embedd.it/img/explorer2.mp4" />

1. Component Name shows the component's part number

2. Documentation folder contains all component-related documentation, including different datasheet revisions

3. Configuration folder (nested under each Documentation version) contains editable Digital Component Models. Users can create multiple configurations, while a default "system" configuration maintains the unedited version

4. Drivers folder stores the generated driver source code library for each configuration

5. Testing folder contains the testing environment for each configuration

**The Component Explorer also features:**

* Upload datasheet button (see next section for details)

* Three-dot menu for accessing User Profile, Documentation, and Logout

**The Application Screen** uses a tab-based interface similar to VSCode.&#x20;

  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://embedd.it/img/ApplicationScreen.mp4" />

Clicking items in the Component Explorer (configurations, datasheets, testing environments, or code) opens them in new tabs.

**Here's the typical workflow:**

1. Upload a datasheet

2. View the created component in Explorer and its opened configuration

3. Customize the configuration in the Application Screen based on your needs. Your changes create a new configuration in the Explorer

4. Generate Testing, Driver, or Documentation as neededâ€”each creates a new tab in the Explorer
