Don't use VSCode? You can still access all Embedd features through your browser.&#x20;

[**Web based platform**](https://platform.embedd.it)

Both the VSCode Extension and web-based application are built on VSCode and provide the same experience. Your account data is accessible through both platforms.

Please note that for optimal performance, we **DO NOT** recommend using the web-based application with the following browsers:

| Browser name | Version |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Mozilla      |         |
| Brave        |         |
