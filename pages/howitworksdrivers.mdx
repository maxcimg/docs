The system converts a Component Model into a driver library through automated code generation. This process parses the structured component data and selected target options to output corresponding source code files. The code generation process is deterministic—with no AI involvement—ensuring consistent and stable outputs. 

The workflow lets users test components before generating code, reducing development cycles and debugging time.

To generate drivers, simply select your targets and click the "Generate Driver" button. The driver library appears instantly and matches your chosen configuration. You can generate multiple drivers for different targets from a single Device Model configuration.
