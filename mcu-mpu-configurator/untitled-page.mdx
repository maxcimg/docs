### **UI Overview**

MCU/MPU Configurator is a tool developed by the [Embedd.it](http://Embedd.it) team that provides an intuitive interface for working with device trees. It enables efficient configuration and modification of device tree structures and generates DTS files reflecting all applied user configurations.

The MCU/MPU configuration interface is logically divided into four main areas:

- **Sidebar Panel** — provides a hierarchical view of MCU/MPU nodes and allows users to navigate and interact with the device tree structure.
- **Properties Panel** — displays and allows configuration of the properties for the currently selected node.
- \*\*Schematic View \*\* — provides a representation of the MCU/MPU, allowing for interactive configuration of pin assignments and functions.
- **Logic View** —  visually represents the division of MCU/MPU modules into functional blocks, including blocks with external outputs and internal modules. This view also indicates which functions are enabled for each module and the corresponding pins on which they are activated.
