All extracted information contains metadata linking it to specific sections of the datasheet. For convenience, we've created a PDF Mode with Backlink feature, which lets you view the PDF alongside your configuration. When you press the Backlink button in PDF Mode and select any data point in the Component Model, you'll be automatically taken to the source section in the datasheet.

You can also use standard PDF search functionality and navigate through document links.
