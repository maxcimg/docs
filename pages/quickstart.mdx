title: "Welcome to Embedd"

Embedd is a development tool designed for embedded software and electronics engineers to streamline integration and testing of semiconductor chips. Our approach stems from a belief that the inefficient data transfer between chip makers and integrators slows down and increases risks of the development process.

Embedd leverages AI to convert complex chip data in the form of PDF datasheets, user manuals, erratas into machine-readable models that become the backbone of the service.

We utilise stabilised chip representations in order to:

* Facilitate driver generation

* Allow fast functional testing

* Generate documentation

As user of Embedd you will be able to process component datasheet into an editable digital model that can be used to generate driver code, tests and documentation for multitude of targets.
