If you are not VSCode user you are still able to access all of the Embedd capabilities via browser. Both VSCode Extension and Web-based applications are built upon VSCode and would provide identical user experience. All of the information saved in your account is accessible through both as well.

Please note, that for best performance we DO NOT recommend using web-based application with the following browsers:

\| Browser Name | Version  |

\| --- | --- |

\| Mozilla  |  |
