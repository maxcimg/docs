Since we use generative AI to extract information from datasheets—which sometimes lack complete component information—we've implemented robust error management tools to help you.

Errors act as blockers—you cannot proceed to driver or testing generation until you resolve them.

The system also includes warnings, which appear in orange. These non-blocking notifications highlight potentially inconsistent elements in your Component Model.

*How do I know there is an error?*

When a section contains an error, a red dot appears above the chapter name. Navigate to that section to see error details.

*How do I find an error inside the section?*

In smaller sections (like General component information), error fields are highlighted in red.

For larger sections (like Registers), we provide an error navigation menu below the Component Model chapters. This menu shows the error count and offers buttons to navigate between errors.

*Which types of errors exist?*



| Error Name | Description | Resolution |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
|            |             |            |
