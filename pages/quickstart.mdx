Embedd is a development tool that helps embedded software and electronics engineers streamline chip integration and testing. We believe that inefficient data exchange between semiconductor manufacturers and integrators creates delays and increases development risks.

Embedd uses AI to convert complex chip documentation—including PDF datasheets, user manuals, and errata—into machine-readable models that power the service.

These standardized chip models enable us to:
