Data types define the structure and format of data stored in registers or used by commands. Multiple registers and commands can share a single data type, ensuring consistency in data interpretation across the device. Each data type can be either a bitmap (for bit-field structures) or an integer (for numerical values).

For each data type, the model contains:

| Section Name | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Datatype Name | Name of the Data type associated with the register |
| Datatype Type | Defines between bitmap or int type of the register. |
| Datatype Size | Determines total size of the datatype |
| Datatype description | Provides description of the datatype |

Currently system support the following types of the data types: 

- Bitmap - an aggregator of integer types
- Int - represents whole numbers and can be in both Signed and Unsigned form
