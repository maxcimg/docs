# Embedd Explorer Structure

üí° All of your components are stored in the Embedd Explorer, i.e. component tree.

Embedd Explorer has the following structure:

1. Component Name  reflects part number of the component
2. Documentation  folder that will contain all of the documentation related to the component. Each component might have multiple documentation sources, i.e. reflecting datasheet revisions.
3. Configuration  each Documentation version will have a nested Configuration folder. Configurations are editable representations of Digital Component Model. The folder will contain all of the configurations user generates for that documentation set. A default, ‚Äúsystem‚Äù configuration will always be available and hold unedited configuration.
4. Drivers  folder with driver source code library will be nested under each configuration, if user generated code for it.
