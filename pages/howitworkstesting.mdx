Embedd provides a streamlined testing environment that allows you to bring-up and test components in real-time. Here's how it works:

**1. Quick Device Setup**

Upload datasheet and configure your Component Model. Connect your development board to your computer and select it from our library of 600+ supported boards. The system automatically handles driver installation and project setup. Flash the pre-integrated firmware containing your component driver with just two clicks.

**2. Interactive Testing Interface**

Once connected, you can:

- Access and modify register-level data in real-time
- Test different configuration modes using our AI-enabled setup manager
- Apply mathematical formulas to process raw sensor values
- Visualize and analyze data through customizable outputs

**3. Advanced Features**

The testing environment offers several powerful capabilities:

- Configure data sampling frequency to match your requirements
- Export time-series data or download complete log files
- Compare raw and processed values
- Integrate custom development kits (with Enterprise subscription)

All of these features are available through our intuitive interface, requiring no coding knowledge to operate.
