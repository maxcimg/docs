The Zephyr driver implementation integrates with the Zephyr RTOS ecosystem, providing a scalable and portable solution. At this point only a limited coverage of Zephyr driver is provided, covering register access. Class specific APIs are currently being added to the system. 


The file structure of the generated Zephyr driver is as follows: 

| File name | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| Data_types.h  |  |
| Registers.h |  |
| Registers.c |  |
| part_name.h |  |
| part_name.c |  |
| Kconfig |  |
| part_name.yaml |  |
| README.md |  |
