### DTS Generation 

User can generate and download the DTS file to their device. The generated DTS always includes all applied changes, if any.

During DTS generation, the system automatically performs a compilation check. As a result, one of the following messages is displayed:

- a message indicating successful compilation;
- an error message specifying the exact location of the compilation error.

Please note that the generated DTS file can be downloaded regardless of the compilation result.

To generate the DTS file, click [Generate DTS] in the MCU/MPU Shematic/Logical view section.

To download the DTS file, click [Download DTS].
