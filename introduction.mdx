## [Digital Component Model](/pages/digital-component-model)

Embeddâ€™s digital component model is a digital representation of the semiconductor datasheet.

We use a proprietary AI engine to process the datasheet and extract information related to the embedded code for each component. This allows users to streamline datasheet interaction and consolidate all relevant information about the components they use in one location.

The model is designed to be complete. Therefore, if certain fields are critical to the code but were not identified, manual completion will be required.

Digital component model is split into following sections:

- General info
- Interface
- Registers
- Datatypes
- Events
- State machines (Not available yet)
- Filters (Not available yet)
- Commands (Not available yet)
- Setup (Not available yet)
- Users can effortlessly adjust any data in the model, creating an unlimited number of configurations for each component.

All data extracted from the datasheet is linked back to the original PDF, enabling easy traceability to the page from which it was extracted.

## [Project Options](****************)

To generate the correct code, the user needs to specify the expected code settings.

Currently available settings include:

- Language
- Target architecture / HAL
- Memory allocation strategy
- MCU byte order
- Returning into a queue strategy

## [Code Generator](***********)

Our code generator takes digital component models and project options as inputs, converting them into optimized C code. This enables engineers to bring their designs to life with unmatched efficiency and precision.

Our code generator ensures consistency and reliability in code generation, eliminating the unpredictability and ambiguity often associated with manual coding processes. By adhering to strict rules and algorithms, the generator produces code that adheres to industry standards and best practices, facilitating seamless integration into diverse software environments.
