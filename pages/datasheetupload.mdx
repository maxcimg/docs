To add a new component, press the "Upload Datasheet" button in the Component Explorer and select a datasheet from your local files.

Datasheet processing takes between 5 minutes and an hour. During this time, components will appear with a "processing" label in the related tab. You'll receive an email notification once processing is complete.

After processing finishes, you can access the digital component model by clicking on the component's configuration.
