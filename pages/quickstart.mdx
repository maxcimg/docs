Embedd is a development tool that helps embedded software teams accelerate chip integration, bring-up, and testing.

We believe many delays and integration risks come from fragmented, manual data exchange between semiconductor vendors and the teams integrating components into real systems.

Embedd addresses this with two complementary products:

**Public MCU Configurator**

A free, vendor-agnostic MCU configurator that lets engineers visually set up devices and automatically generate device trees. Start by selecting from supported MCUs or upload your own DTS file to accelerate configuration and reduce bring-up friction.

**Enterprise HAL Automation**

For larger teams, Embedd provides an enterprise toolchain that builds a digital twin of hardware in the context of its software-facing behaviour. From this model, teams can generate hardware abstraction layers and integration artefacts to speed up porting across components, operating systems, and target architectures. This enables faster and more cost-effective evaluation and development of different E/E architecture scenarios, including platform and OS exploration.
