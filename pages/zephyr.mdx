The Zephyr driver implementation integrates with the Zephyr RTOS ecosystem, providing a scalable and portable solution. At this point only a limited coverage of Zephyr driver is provided, covering register access. Class specific APIs are currently being added to the system.

  # Integrating the PRESSURE SENSORS - TRANSDUCERS Driver with custom API

  This README provides instructions on how to integrate the provided custom Zephyr device driver for the LPS22HH Pressure Sensors - Transducers into your project.

  ## 1. File Placement

  Place the following files in your Zephyr project's `include/app/drivers` directory:

  * `Pressure Sensors - Transducers.h` (Driver header file)
  * `Pressure Sensors - Transducers_registers.h` (Register definitions)
  * `Pressure Sensors - Transducers_data_types.h` (Data type definitions)

  Place the following files in your Zephyr project's `drivers/Pressure Sensors - Transducers` directory:

  * `Pressure Sensors - Transducers.c` (Driver source file)
  * `Pressure Sensors - Transducers_registers.c` (Register access functions)
  * `Kconfig` (Driver's configurations)

  Place the following file in your Zephyr project's `dts/bindings/Pressure Sensors - Transducers` directory:

  * `Pressure Sensors - Transducers.yaml` (Devicetree binding file)

  ## 2. Device Tree Overlay

  You'll need to create a device tree overlay file (e.g., `app/boards/your_board.overlay`) to instantiate the Pressure Sensors - Transducers driver.

  Here's an example:

  I2C:

  ```dts
  &i2c1 {
    Pressure Sensors - Transducers@77 {
      status = "okay";
      compatible = "<vendor_nickname>,Pressure Sensors - Transducers";
      reg = <0x77>;
    };
  };
  ```

  This overlay adds a Pressure Sensors - Transducers device node on I2C1 bus with address 0x77. Adjust the bus number and address according to your hardware setup.

  SPI:

  ```dts
  &spi1 {
    status = "okay";
    cs-gpios = <&gpiob 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

    Pressure Sensors - Transducers@0 {
      status = "okay";
      compatible = "st,Pressure Sensors - Transducers";
      reg = <0>;
      spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
    };
  };
  ```

  This overlay adds a Pressure Sensors - Transducers device node on SPI1 bus with CS-GPIO 0. Adjust the bus number, CS-GPIO and SPI frequency according to your hardware setup.

  ## 3. CMakeLists.txt Modifications

  Create a `drivers/Pressure Sensors - Transducers/CMakeLists.txt` file with the following lines to create a cmake library project:

  ```cmake
  zephyr_library()
  zephyr_library_sources_ifdef(CONFIG_Pressure Sensors - Transducers Pressure Sensors - Transducers.c Pressure Sensors - Transducers_registers.c)
  ```

  Update or create if needed the `drivers/CMakeLists.txt` file with thi following line to include the driver's library depending on the configuration:

  ```cmake
  add_subdirectory_ifdef(CONFIG_Pressure Sensors - Transducers Pressure Sensors - Transducers)
  ```

  ## 4. Kconfig Integration

  To make your driver configurable through Kconfig, you need include your Kconfig file in your `/drivers/Kconfig` file using:

  ```kconfig
  rsource "Pressure Sensors - Transducers/Kconfig"
  ```

  ## 5. Usage Example

  Here's a simple example of how to use the driver in your application code:

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>#include <zephyr/kernel.h>#include <app/drivers/Pressure Sensors - Transducers.h>void main(void)
  {
      const struct device *const dev = DEVICE_DT_GET_ONE(st_Pressure Sensors - Transducers);

      if (!device_is_ready(dev)) {
          printf("Device %s is not ready.\n", dev->name);
          return 0;
      }

      /* USER CODE BEGIN */

      /* USER CODE END */
  }
  ```

The file structure of the generated Zephyr driver is as follows:

| File name       | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Data\_types.h   |             |
| Registers.h     |             |
| Registers.c     |             |
| part\_name.h    |             |
| part\_name.c    |             |
| Kconfig         |             |
| part\_name.yaml |             |
| README.md       |             |
