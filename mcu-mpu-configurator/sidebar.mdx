### **Sidebar**

After an MCU/MPU is added, the corresponding model appears in the MCU/MPU Sidebar Panel and can be expanded. Expanding the model reveals the _Pin Configuration_ section, which contains the device tree structure with configurable nodes.

Users can interact with the nodes within the device tree in the following ways:

- Open the MCU/MPU schematic by clicking either on the _Pin Configuration_ section or on the name of any node in the sidebar.
- Open the Properties Panel for a specific node by selecting its name in the sidebar.
- Rename a node by right-clicking on the node and selecting Rename.
- Delete a node by right-clicking on it and selecting "Delete".
- Add a new node by clicking the [ + ] icon next to the desired parent node.\
  After clicking the [ + ] icon next to the desired parent node, a dialog is displayed allowing the user to either add a new blank node or select a node from the available list.
- Reorder or relocate nodes using drag-and-drop functionality.
