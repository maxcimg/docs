### Using Generated DTS in Your Project

Once the DTS is generated, follow these steps to integrate it with your Zephyr project:

1. **Place the DTS File in Your Project**
   - Copy the generated .dts file into your project folder, typically under boards/\<your_board\>/.
   - Optionally, you can rename it to match your board or peripheral configuration.
2. **Update the Board Configuration**
   - Update your CMakeLists.txt or board configuration to point to the new DTS file.
   - Ensure that Zephyr uses this DTS file when building your project by specifying it in the BOARD.dts path.
3. **Rebuild Your Project**
   - Run west build or your preferred Zephyr build command.
   - Verify that the project compiles successfully without DTS validation errors.
